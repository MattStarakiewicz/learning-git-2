            End of passion play, crumbling away<br />
            I'm your source of self-destruction<br />
            Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear<br />
            Leading on your death's construction<br />
            <br /><br />
            Taste me, you will see<br />
            More is all you need<br />
            Dedicated to<br />
            How I'm killing you<br />
            <br /><br />
            Come crawling faster<br />
            Obey your master<br />
            Your life burns faster<br />
            Obey your master<br />
            <br /><br />
            Master!<br />
            <br /><br />
            Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings<br />
            Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams<br />
            Blinded by me, you can't see a thing<br />
            Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream<br />
            <br /><br />
            Master!<br />
            Master!<br />
            <br />
            Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream<br />
            <br />
            Master!<br />
            Master!<br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Needlework the way, never you betray<br />
            Life of death becoming clearer<br />
            Pain monopoly, ritual misery<br />
            Chop your breakfast on a mirror<br />
            <br /><br />
            Taste me you will see<br />
            More is all you need<br />
            Dedicated to<br />
            How I'm killing you<br />
            <br /><br />
            Come crawling faster<br />
            Obey your master<br />
            Your life burns faster<br />
            Obey your master<br />
            <br /><br />
            Master!<br />
            <br /><br />
            Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings<br />
            Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams<br />
            Blinded by me, you can't see a thing<br />
            Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream<br />
            <br /><br />
            Master!<br />
            Master!<br />
            <br /><br />
            Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream<br />
            <br />
            Master!<br />
            Master!<br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Master, master!<br />
            Where's the dreams that I've been after?<br />
            Master, master!<br />
            Promised only lies<br />
            Laughter, laughter<br />
            All I hear or see is laughter<br />
            Laughter, laughter<br />
            Laughing at my cries<br />
            Fix me!<br />
            <br /><br />
            Hell is worth all that, natural habitat<br />
            Just a rhyme without a reason<br />
            Never-ending maze, drift on numbered days<br />
            Now your life is out of season<br />
            <br /><br />
            I will occupy<br />
            I will help you die<br />
            I will run through you<br />
            Now I rule you too<br />
            <br /><br />
            Come crawling faster<br />
            Obey your master<br />
            Your life burns faster<br />
            Obey your master<br />
            <br /><br />
            Master!<br />
            <br /><br />
            Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings<br />

            Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream<br />
            <br /><br />
            Master!<br />
            Master!<br />
            <br /><br />
            Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream<br />
            <br /><br />
            Master!<br />
